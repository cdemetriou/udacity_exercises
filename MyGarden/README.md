# MyGarden App

An app where you have plants in  a garden and are able to water them. Be careful though cause plants die if you forget to water them in time.
The app uses widgets to provide updates on the plants condition. Two types of widgets are available, single plant with the functionality of watering it, or presenting all plants in a grid view.
